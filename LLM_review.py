Review Summary

File: review_human.py
Overall: Implementation is correct and returns the first n terms of the Leibniz series. A few small readability and efficiency improvements are recommended.
Findings & Suggestions

Unused variable: pairs = n // 2 is defined but never used — remove it.
Sign computation: ((-1) ** i) works but is less efficient and slightly less clear than toggling a sign variable.
Negative n handling: Returning 0.0 for n < 0 is permissive; consider raising ValueError to surface bad input (or at least document this behavior).
Annotations & docstring: Add -> float return annotation and make the docstring precise about n semantics.
Performance (optional): For large n consider pairwise summation (1/(4p+1) - 1/(4p+3)) or Kahan summation to reduce floating-point error and improve convergence behaviour.
Style: Minor spacing and PEP8 formatting improvements would help readability.
Minimal patch (recommended) — small, low-risk changes to apply now:

def leibniz_sum_2j(n: int) -> float:
    """
    Compute partial sums of the Leibniz formula for π.

    n : Number of terms to include (n >= 0, int)

    Returns: sum of the first n terms of the Leibniz series (float)
    """
    if n < 0:
        return 0.0

    total = 0.0
    sign = 1.0
    for i in range(n):
        total += sign / (2 * i + 1.0)
        sign = -sign

    return total

Alternative (recommended if you want better numeric behavior) — use pairwise summation and raise error on bad input:

def leibniz_sum_2j(n: int) -> float:
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be non-negative")

    total = 0.0
    pairs = n // 2
    for p in range(pairs):
        total += 1.0/(4*p + 1.0) - 1.0/(4*p + 3.0)
    if n % 2 == 1:
        total += 1.0/(2*n - 1)
    return total

Would you like me to:

apply the minimal patch to review_human.py now, or
apply the pairwise-version patch (and switch to ValueError for negative n), or
leave the file unchanged and only keep these review notes?
